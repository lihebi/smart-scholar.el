For each of them, the package will manage
- crawl the website for a bib file list, for each year
- for each bib entry, figure out what is the pdf link
- download pdfs automatically, in background
- do all these at once

Also, I noticed that downloading htmls and pdfs from publishers
website is likely to be very slow, due to the visit limit of the
publishers. Thus, I might want to store a git mirror of all webpages
of these conferences. There might be copyright issues, but I think for
webpages that is fine.

The pdf cannot be mirrored: they are too large and has copyright
concern.
